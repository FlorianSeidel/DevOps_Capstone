There are three repositories.
Please have a look at README.md of https://github.com/FlorianSeidel/DevOps_Capstone
for documentation and as an entrypoint.

There is also https://github.com/FlorianSeidel/DevOps_Capstone_Service, which contains a toy service for this project.
It also contains the Jenkinsfile.

Then there is https://github.com/FlorianSeidel/DevOps_Capstone_Deployment, which contains among other things, the Jenkins
configuration.

To get a complete overview, please have a look at  README.md of https://github.com/FlorianSeidel/DevOps_Capstone, though.
The required screenshots are also included at the end of the README.md.

Regarding the requirement to setup AWS EKS using cloudformation.
I consider using eksctl to fullfil this requirement. It generates cloudformation resources from a configuration file and
applies them.

The deployment method chosen is blue/green. There is a complete step-by-step walk-through at the end of README.md in
the DevOps_Capstone project.
